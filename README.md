# ArmorPoints-Plusplus
A small Minecraft mod that allows you to see more than 20 armor points and let you stack your health onto one bar [ BUGTRACKER ]

There is a feature-complete description of this mod over on the [Curseforge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/armorpoints) of this mod and thus I won't write anything detailed here.
