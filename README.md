# ArmorPoints-Plusplus
A small Minecraft mod that allows you to see more than 20 armor points and let you stack your health onto one bar

Currently there is only a bugtracker here, but when I start rewriting the whole mod, the v2 code will be available here, too.

There is a feature-complete description of this mod over on the [Curseforge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/armorpoints) of this mod and thus I won't write anything detailed here.
